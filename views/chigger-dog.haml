    If captured by a chigger dog feels a hell lot of irritation due to the extreme itchiness. Chigger is the name given to the larvae form of harvest mites, possessing a parasitic behaviour, hence feeding on the skin fluids of mammals. These arachnid Trombicula mites feed on cats, dogs and even people, causing severe itching. When bitten by a chigger, as bad as poison ivy dog experiences itchiness.

    Chiggers are usually found in grasslands and woody areas, from where your pets collect them and let them bite down their skin tissues. Chiggers' bites can cause red itchy welts on skin, which if scratched again and again can develop into hives etc.

    Belonging to the same order of Arachnids, ticks are extremely dangerous insects. Owing to the small size of ticks, they are also referred to as seed ticks dog is hence unable to spot them out. In case of an infected tick dog, there is a risk of contraction of many tick-borne diseases like Tick paralysis, Lyme disease etc. A Deer tick dog is an unlikely term that I have come across, because it is rare to find any deer tick interested in a dog rather than chigger dog.

    Like ticks, fleas also dwell on the blood of mammals. Infested by flea dog becomes very annoyed. Fleas have powerful hind legs, which allow them to jump from one host to another, making their mark as a fast spreading pest. Flea allergy, tapeworms etc may be the outcome of flea bites on your pup. Mosquitoes ruin the peace of your house during warmer months. They are tiny insects that need blood to survive. Only adult female mosquitoes feed on the blood of animals and humans for reproduction. Similar to ticks, mosquito also carries deadly diseases for your pet. Having mosquito bites dog can be infected by the sWest Nile virus, heatworm disease etc. Affected by mange or mites dog experiences itching, irritation, hair loss and skin inflammation. Scabies is also caused by a certain type of mites which burrow into the skin of the host dog. A scabies dog suffers from ugly skin infection that may spread all over the body. Your pet then loses lots of hair and looks quite older than his age. Prevention of such insects is very important if you don't want your pets to fall prey.
