    However, while talking about the term 'bed mites' people refer to bed bugs as well as Dust mites. Both of them are a nuisance to people. These unwelcome guests are the cause of many health problems. And guess what, their favorite hideout is our bed! While bed bugs are small nocturnal parasites that survive on blood of other mammals, whereas bed mites are microscopic organisms that feed on the skin flakes, hair and oil secreted by our bodies. Commonly found in beddings, they also make their homes in carpeting, curtain seams and other upholstery. Due to the cohabitation of dust mites, many people develop allergies causing breathing problems, itching, hives, running nose, rashes etc.
