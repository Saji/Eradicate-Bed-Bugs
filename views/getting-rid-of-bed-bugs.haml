    Getting rid of bed bugs might seem to be very difficult to commoners. Yet, the exterminators know it all. Let me share some information about these nasty bloodsuckers. Adult bed bugs appear to be brown to copper in color. They are wingless and nocturnal scroungers. Human blood is what a bed bug prefers to have. Swollen red blemishes develop wherever the bedbug feeds on the skin. If their population is not checked at the earliest, bedbugs multiply with tremendous speed.
