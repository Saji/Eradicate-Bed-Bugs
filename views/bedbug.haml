  Bed bugs pictures show that bedbugs have two sets of tubes to insert in the body of the host that it feeds on. One of the tubes injects saliva to numb the skin, and the other sucks blood. Due to this they are one of the most irritating mites and can also cause skin inflammation.

  When infected by bed bugs, you wake up in the morning with itchy red skin that resembles a mosquito bite; it might be one of the major bed bugs symptoms. Bed bugs signs also include miniature brown stains on the sheet, sore skin, or tiny droplets of blood on your skin. These signs don't necessarily mean that there is a bed bug infection. These can also be symptoms of scabies, a skin disease caused by to itch mites. To know for sure that bed bugs are the ones infesting your house, you should carefully examine mattress and other likely places for any sort of bed bug waste such as dark brown circles around their hiding places etc. A faint rotten odor is likely to haunt infected mattresses.

  Once sure about the infestation, remedies for bed bugs treatment are a must. Bed bugs extermination methods include the use of natural solutions, pesticides and newly introduced bed bugs spray. These pesticides, though effective, are harmful to human skin and eyes. Caution should be observed while using these chemical products. However using both the means to eradicate this problem might prove more useful than any one of them individually. Especially trained dogs to detect bed bug presence are also effective. They detect the presence of bed bugs faster and more effectively than humans owing the credit due to their sensitive nose.

  Ticks pictures and fleas pictures reveal two such sets of tubes but unlike bed bugs, they are found in woody outdoor regions. Ticks have a set of small teeth that are used as anchor to attach them to the host's body. These bugs also feed on human blood and they leave the host when they are full. In normal circumstances it is very difficult to separate the tick from the host. In case of a flea, it leaves a single puncture mark on the host contrary to that of a bed bug. Fleas can cause advanced skin inflammation and irritation on the body of the host that it inhabits. The irritation can last for some time ranging from a few seconds to a couple of hours depending on how sensitive one's skin is.

  Bed bugs pictures are thus quite helpful to let us understand the nature and havoc the bed bugs cause.
