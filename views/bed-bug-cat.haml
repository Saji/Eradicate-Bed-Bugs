    In order to kill a Bed Bug Cat litter can prove to be very effective Silica gel found in cat litter is powdered and then spread in the bed bug affected areas. This powder will stick to the bed bugs and dehydrate them, bringing their life to an end. But do not stay under the impression that your cat is safe from bed bugs. Bed bugs may still bite that pretty, fluffy pet of yours.

    When bitten by Bed Bug Cat may also develop similar kind of red welts and rashes from itching like humans. Moreover, cats have sharp claws, and when they use it for itching, imagine what trouble they'll get in. Same is the case with a dog affected by bed bugs. Although specially trained dogs have the ability to detect bed bugs, yet they too are prone to bed bugs bites. So, the point is when attacked by Bed Bug Cat or human, is going to fall prey.

    Spider bites are somewhat rare in cats. Some cats play with spiders, hunt for them and even eat them. As cat's skin is thicker than others, there are three types of spiders that can cause serious damage to it- Black widow, brown spiders and Hobo spider. When bitten by any of the above spider cat can get muscle crumpling, tissue breakdown etc. Immediate medical attention is required; otherwise the cat may die within 4-5 days.

    Scabies is a highly contagious skin disease that is caused due to the burrowing of itch mites into the skin. If suffering from scabies cat may develop health issues like itching, hair loss and crusts. Cat scabies is also known as feline mange. This can spread over the whole body of the cat and aggressive care is suggested.

    Lice cat is the term I am using for this host specific louse named Felicola Subrostrata. It is a chewing louse and only infests cats. Aged, hairy and low immunity cats are more vulnerable to this type of lice. Here, cats experience restlessness, scruffy coat, itching, loss of hair and anaemia.

    If attacked by mites cat contracts a skin disorder called cat mange. Starting from the ear, face and neck, the sores may spread to the whole body of the cat. Dandruff, itchiness, sores etc are its symptoms.  When plagiarised by flea cat develops an allergic reaction, which again causes itching, hair loss and rough skin called flea bite dermatitis. Tick cat sounds to be a tickling term indeed. Ticks on cats can be easily brushed off, and if it is done within a day, then there is no risk of infection. Yet, there are many diseases that ticks carry, for example, rocky mountain fever, cat Lyme disease etc. Hence those frisky kittens should be kept safe and clean so as to avoid such bugs bugging them.
